My name is Cheng Peng, a senior student from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I have had the privilege of being supervised by Professor Biaoshuai Tao in research on Algorithmic Game Theory during my underguate years. My research interests are mainly in the interdisciplinary area between theoretical computer science and economics, including facility location games, resource allocation problems and algorithmic game theory. In a layperson’s terms, my research agenda can be described as designing algorithms that facilitate cooperation and make fairer and better decisions.

During my undergraduate years, I was immensely fortunate to receive guidance from several kind and inspiring professors. I am deeply thankful to them: Prof.Biaoshuai Tao, Prof.Haris Aziz, Prof.Toby Walsh, Prof.Lirong Xia, Prof.Minming Li, Prof.Hau Chan.
