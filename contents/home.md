My name is Cheng Peng, a senior student from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I have had the privilege of being supervised by Professor Biaoshuai Tao in research on Algorithmic Mechanism Design. Additionally, I had the opportunity to visit the Algorithmic Decision Theory (ADT) Group at UNSW Sydney, led by Professors Haris Aziz and Toby Walsh. 

During my undergraduate years, I was immensely fortunate to receive guidance from several kind and inspiring professors. I am deeply thankful to them: Prof.Biaoshuai Tao, Prof.Haris Aziz, Prof.Toby Walsh, Prof.Lirong Xia, Prof.Minming Li, Prof.Hau Chan.
